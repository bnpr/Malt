# External Tools

## VSCode

*Malt* has built-in integration with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com), including a workaround to provide GLSL intellisense via C++ language servers.  
When *Malt* is the active render engine, it will auto-setup a *VSCode* workspace on the same folder you save your *.blend* file.  
>*(This feature can be disabled in the Addon Preferences)*

## RenderDoc

*Malt* has built-in integration with [RenderDoc](https://renderdoc.org).  
It can be enabled by setting path to the **renderdoccmd** executable in the addon settings.  
Onnce Malt has been initialized, RenderDoc can be attached to Malt through the [attach to running instance](https://renderdoc.org/docs/window/capture_connection.html) option.
