## Current State

Malt development began on June 2020 and it's still in beta state.
It's quite complete feature wise, but still unstable and backwards compatibility is not yet warranteed.

Malt is software agnostic, but Blender is the only integration planned right now.

## Requirements

- OpenGL 4.1 support.
- Latest Blender release.

> A dedicated Nvidia or AMD graphics card is highly recomended.  
> Intel cards are likely to cause problems and F12 rendering doesn't work with them.

## Install
 
- Go to [the latest Release page](https://github.com/bnpr/Malt/releases/tag/v1-beta).
- Download the *BlenderMalt* version that matches your OS and the *Shader Examples*.
- Open Blender. Go to *Preferences > Addons*, click on the *Install...* button and select *BlenderMalt.zip* from your downloads. *(It will take a few seconds)*
- Tick the box in the *BlenderMalt* panel to enable it.

#### Uninstall

- Untick the box in *Preferences > Addons > BlenderMalt* to disable the addon.
- Restart *Blender*.
- Go back to *Preferences > Addons > BlenderMalt*, expand the panel and click the *Remove* button.

## First steps

- Go to *Scene Settings* and change the renderer to *Malt*.
- Create a *Sunlight* and add a new *Object* with a new *Material*.
- Inside the *Material* settings set the *Shader Source* to one of the files from the *Shader Examples*.

For better viewport performance, you may want to lower the rendering quality:
- Go to *Scene Settings > Malt Settings*.
- Set *Transparency Layers* to **1**.
- Lower the *ShadowMaps* resolution to **1024** or even **512**.
- Make sure *Line Width Max* is not higher than **10**.

To learn how to make your own materials in *Malt*, take a look at the [From Nodes To Code](https://malt3d.com/#/docs/From-Nodes-To-Code/From-Nodes-To-Code) tutorial.

**For bug reports include**:
- A ***System Info* report** generated by Blender *(Help > Save System Info)*.

## Developer Documentation
 
Developer documentation is best viewed directly in Github, most folders in the source code have relevant documentation.  
The [Malt folder documentation](https://github.com/bnpr/Malt/tree/master/Malt#malt) is a good starting point.
